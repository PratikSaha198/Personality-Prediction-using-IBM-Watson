This TransAwarenessWeek  we invited members of our Trans at Google employee network to share their perspectives on trans visibility and their own experience. We celebrate trans voices both inside and outside of Google  and we stand with the community against the issues faced by trans and gender non binary people.  Alon Altman Site Reliability Engineer  Google   I came out as trans pretty much as soon as I realized it myself  back in     . Before coming out I did some experimentation with my gender presentation and talked with some trusted friends. It didn't take long to realize that I never really saw myself as a man and always felt at home in the queer community. It took somewhat longer to come out to my family  who still do not fully accept me for who I am. Trans Awareness Week and the subsequent Trans Day of Remembrance are important to me because they connect us to our community. We remember our fallen siblings and celebrate those of us who are still fighting.  Eli Stevens Site Reliability Engineer  YouTube   I just recently came out as trans at work  though it's been a long road to get here. I've known for years that I didn't feel at home in my body or in my gender  but I was so scared to admit this to anyone out loud. I knew as soon as I did  it would become real  and I felt as long as I didn't tell anyone  it wasn't something real  not a part of my life. It took me a long time to finally feel confident and brave enough to come out fully and authentically  but I think I really needed that time to be where I am today. I'm proud to finally be out and I'm proud of how far I've come to be here.
